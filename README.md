# MEAN Entities

Test app for parsing entities based on type attribute.

Uses:

* Mongo for the Database, with Mongoose as the ORM.
* Express for the server framework.
* Angular for the client-side framework.
* Node as the server platform.

Also makes heavy use of the Q promise library for wrapping node-style callbacks in promises.

### To run:

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

```
node server.js
```

Note: make sure you have node installed, and an instance of mongo running.
